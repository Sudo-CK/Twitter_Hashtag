# Twitter_Hashtag
This script requires python3, tkinter and twitter tweepy api, through which we can connect to twitter and analyze / retrieve the twitter data searched for by a certain hashtag. 
> NOTE: Searching for a hashtag may take some time depending on the number of Tweets being searched and the computer resources available. It is recommended to wait until the recordings are available.
